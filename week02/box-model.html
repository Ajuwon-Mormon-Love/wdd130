            <blockquote>
                <p>8 Finally, be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of another, love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous:</p>
                <p>9 Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwise blessing; knowing that ye are thereunto called, that ye should inherit a blessing.</p>
                <p>10 For he that will love life, and see good days, let him arefrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile:</p>
                <p>11 Let him eschew evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and ensue it.</p>
